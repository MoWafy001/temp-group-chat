(heroku link)[https://one-time-group-chat.herokuapp.com/] (if it doesn't work, I might have deleted it)

# Info
The user goes to the home page, clicks `"create room"`, then gets redirected to a room with a generated id.
The user could then share the room link with whome they want to add to the chat. The messages are not stored. If they leave, the messages are gone.
